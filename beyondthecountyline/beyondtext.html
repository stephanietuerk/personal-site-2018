<p>"Demography is destiny." Or is it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 2016 Presidential election called into question long-held narratives about how demographic change in the United States would effect election outcomes. Almost immediately after the election, the idea that America's ethnic diversification would ensure Democratic dominance was supplanted by claims that a previously overlooked "silent majority" had delivered a Republican victory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That the national conversation about American demography could change so much more quickly than the facts of who lives in the United States suggests that the question of how demographic characteristics do or not map onto particular political positions could benefit from methodical examination of actual data. Using returns from federal elections in Pennsylvania in 2012 and 2016, as well as data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, this visualization allows users to literally see for themselves how five different demographic characteristics did or did not correlate to voting outcomes. It does this at a far greater resolution than what typical election analysis shows, by displaying both election and demographic data at the census tract rather than the usual county level. Disaggregating the data from 67 counties to 3,217 census tracts of approximately 4,000 people each offers a much more granular view that preserves the small, demographically and/or politically homogenous areas that tend to disappear when data is presented as county-wide averages, and that were the subject of much debate in the fall of 2016.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Users can interact with the visualization in a number of ways to understand both geographic and demographic trends in 2016 and 2012 elections, as well as change between those years. Census tract-level election results displayed in the top map can be sorted by demographic characteristic in the lower (very long) chart, allowing users to examine the data behind suppositions about voting patterns among particular demographic groups. Anomalous census tracts &mdash; for example, a tract with a high percentage of non-white residents that, unlike those who share that demographic characteristic, cast a majority of votes for the Republican candidate &mdash; can be easily visually identified, and then located in the map once selected on the right-hand side of the chart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Although the data used in this visualization is readily available, the discrepancy between boundaries of voting districts &mdash; established and administered by state and local authorities &mdash; and those of census tracts &mdash; determined by the U.S. Census Bureau &mdash; makes the direct comparison of these two datasets challenging, and is one explanation for why few maps with this level of detail exist. I created the data shown here by aggregating vote totals from 9,256 local voting precincts to the census tracts in which they are located, splitting votes in proportion to land area in cases of boundary overlap. Because shapefiles are not available for voting precints, this operation was performed with correspondence files from the Missouri Census Data Center's <a href="http://mcdc.missouri.edu/websas/geocorr14.html">MABLE/Geocorr14 project</a>. Demographic data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau's <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/">American Community Survey</a>. Pennsylvania precint-level election results are available from <a href="https://github.com/openelections">Open Elections</a>.</p>
