<p>"Demography is destiny." Or is it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 2016 U.S. Presidential election sparked significant reconsideration of the relationship between demographics and voting patterns in the United States. In the weeks after the election, long-held narratives that framed Democratic ascendence as an inevitablility of America's steady ethnic diversification were supplanted by expos√©s of a previously overlooked "silent majority" that delivered a Republican victory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet the facts of who lives in the U.S. change at a much slower pace than the media's shift in perspective about which groups are most critical to electoral victories, suggesting that further inquiry about this topic could benefit from methodical examination of actual data. This visualization allows users to evaluate narratives about who votes for whom by literally seeing for themselves how five different demographic characteristics did or did not correlate to voting outcomes, using the state of Pennsylvania as a case study. The visualization differs most significantly from typical election analysis maps by displaying both election and demographic data at the census tract rather than county level. Disaggregating the data from 67 counties to 3,217 census tracts of approximately 4,000 people each offers a much more granular view that preserves the small, demographically and/or politically homogenous areas that tend to disappear when data is presented as county-wide averages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Users can interact with the visualization in a number of ways to understand both geographic and demographic trends in federal elections in 2016 and 2012, as well as change between those years. Census tract-level election results displayed in the top map can then be sorted by demographic characteristic in the lower (very long) chart, allowing users to examine the data behind suppositions about voting patterns among particular demographic groups. Anomalous census tracts &mdash; for example, a tract with a high percentage of non-white residents that, unlike those who share that demographic characteristic, cast a majority of votes for the Republican candidate &mdash; can be easily visually identified, and then located in the map once selected in the chart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Although the data used in this visualization is readily available, the discrepancy between boundaries of voting districts &mdash; established and administered by state and local authorities &mdash; and those of census tracts &mdash; determined by the U.S. Census Bureau &mdash; makes the direct comparison of these two datasets challenging. I created the data shown here by aggregating vote totals from 9,256 local voting precincts to the census tracts in which they are located, splitting votes in proportion to land area in cases of boundary overlap. Because shapefiles are not available for voting precints, this operation was performed with correspondence files from the Missouri Census Data Center's <a href="http://mcdc.missouri.edu/websas/geocorr14.html">MABLE/Geocorr14 project</a>. Demographic data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau's <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/">American Community Survey</a>. Pennsylvania precint-level election results are available from <a href="https://github.com/openelections">Open Elections</a>.</p>
