    <h1>Hello World, it's me, Stephanie.</h1>
    <p>I am currently a postdoctoral associate in MIT's Department of Architecture with the MIT-SUTD Collaboration. I am trained as an engineer, an architect, and a historian, and recently completed my PhD in MIT's History, Theory, and Criticism of Architecture and Art program.</p>
    <p>During my PhD, I analyzed writings, transcripts, photographs, and drawings produced in the late nineteenth century France to examine a debate about the social utility of aesthetic experience in counteracting the perceived ills of the Industrial Revolution. I wrote many words and included reproductions of images in an appendix at the end of the dissertation, following conventions for knowledge production in the humanities that date back to the nineteeth century.</p>
    <p>Now, as a side project, I want to try producing knowledge in a  new way. Or at least new to me. I want to examine new kinds of primary-source materials, through new methodologies, and present my findings in new forms. And in doing so, I want to return to my earlier training as an engineer and an architect, rekindling my affinity for both quantititive methods and the visual/diagrammatic presentation of information. I am excited to combine all of the ways in which I have been trained in the production of data vizualizations.</p>
    <p>For the time being, this page will serve as a sandbox for my data visualization experiments, exercises, and projects. It is my goal to create visualizations founded on rigorous, systemmatic, and critical thought. On the other hand, I aim not to crash your browser or otherwise complicate things to the point where things don't work. And above all I want to have fun and enjoy the process of learning.</p>

<h2><u>Visualizations I Like</u></h2>
	<p>I'm also going to use this page to collect visualizations that I particularly like.<p>

    <li><h3>Shifting Incomes for American Jobs</h3>by Nathan Yau at Flowing Data

    <p>This is an animated and interactive visualization that you can view in its original form <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2016/06/28/distributions-of-annual-income/">here</a></p>

    <p><u>Why do I like this visualization?</u></p>

    <p>I like this because through interacting with the visualization, I learned something that I wasn't expecting.</p>

    <p>Reasonably educated people know, without needing an info graphic to tell them, that income inequality is a growing problem in the United States. When you look at this graphic statically, it tells you a bit more than that. Yes, it shows you that top paid lawyers make more than anyone in food preparation, but it also shows you how wide the range of salaries are for each given profession.</p> 

    <p>When you start looking at the change between the years -- something that the author has highlighted by adding a sort of "stickiness" and "bounciness" to the dots as the move from one position to another -- you gain insight into how the distribution of salaries has changed over time, both at large, and perhaps more clearly, by profession.</p> 

    <p><i>Some surprising things I learned from interacting with this:</i></p>
    <ul><li>There are a good number of people in the legal profession in both 2000 and 2014 who make between $35k and $75k a year.</li><p></p>
    <li>The proportion of people in the legal profession, management, healthcare, entertainment, education and library, sales, and cleaning and maintenance who make over $200k decreased between 2000 and 2014.</li><p></p>
    <li>During this same period, there was a very significant increase in the proportion of technicians making over $200k, and a noticable increase in the extraction sector.</li><p></p> 
    <li>Although income inequality has only recently become a widely-discussed topic, arguably the most radical shift in distributions occured between 1960 and 1980. In 1960, there are no outlier clusters of incomes at the over $200k level. By 1980, these clusters of dots are established, and from there on (i.e. in 2000 and 20014), the number seems to stay about the same, but they shift back and forth by profession.</li></ul></div>
