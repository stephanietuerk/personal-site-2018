<p>"Demography is destiny." Or is it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 2016 U.S. Presidential election sparked significant reconsideration of the relationship between demographics and voting patterns in the United States. In the weeks after the election, long-held narratives that framed Democratic ascendence as an inevitablility of America's steady ethnic diversification were supplanted by expos√©s of a previously overlooked "silent majority" that delivered a Republican victory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This sudden shift in the perception of American demographics among the media and political pundits, taken alongside reports of how misconceptions about the pace of demographic change influenced voters at the polls suggests that the actual facts of U.S. demography may be difficult to ascertain through media reporting alone. And if it is a challenge to even understand who the American populace is, how can we assess or critically engage with the new narratives about how different demographic groups vote that have emerged to explain the 2016 election?</p>

<p>This visualization lets people explore relationships between votes casts and key demographic characteristics in Pennsylvania at the Census Tract level. Although election results can be obtained for each voting district, the maps produced by media outlets almost always show results at the county level. While U.S. Census data can be obtained for each county, counties are often demographically diverse, making it difficult to understand how voting patterns and demographic characteristics, including population density, correlate across geography.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One reason that election results are rarely compared to demographics at a smaller geographical scale is that census boundaries and voting district boundaries are completely separate in their origins and administration, making these two sets of information difficult to map onto each other. I created the data behind this visualization by aggregating vote totals from each voting district to the census tracts in which districts are located, and splitting votes in proportion to area in cases of boundary overlap.</p>
