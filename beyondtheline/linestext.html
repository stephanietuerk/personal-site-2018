<p>"Demography is destiny." Or is it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 2016 U.S. Presidential election sparked significant reconsideration of the relationship between demographics and voting patterns in the United States. In the weeks after the election, long-held narratives that framed Democratic ascendence as an inevitablility of America's steady ethnic diversification were supplanted by expos√©s of a previously overlooked "silent majority" that delivered a Republican victory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The facts of who lives in the U.S. change at a much slower pace than did media portrayals of the effects of American demographics on election outcomes. This visualization allows users to evaluate both new and old narratives about this topic to literally see for themselves how five different demographic characteristics did or did not correlate to voting outcomes, using the state of Pennsylvania as a case study. It differs from typical election analysis maps by displaying both election and demographic data at the census tract, rather than county level. This offers a much more granular view of the data that preserves the small, demographically and/or politically homogenous areas that tend to disappear when data is presented as county-wide averages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Users can interact with the visualization in a number of ways to understand both geographic and demographic trends in national elections, and change in these trends between 2012 and 2016. Census tract-level election results displayed in the top map can then be sorted by demographic characteristic in the lower (very long) chart, allowing users to examine the data behind suppositions about voting patterns among particular demographic groups. Anomalous census tracts -- for example -- a tract with a high percentage of non-white residents that, unlike those who share that demographic characteristic, casted a majority of votes for the Republican candidate, can be easily visually identified, and then located in the map once selected in the chart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I created the data behind this visualization by aggregating vote totals from each voting district to the census tracts in which districts are located, splitting votes in proportion to land area in cases of boundary overlap. Demographic data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey.</p>
