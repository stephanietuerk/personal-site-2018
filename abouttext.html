<p>Hi there. It's me, Stephanie. I care about how knowledge is produced in the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am trained as a <a class="link" href="https://architecture.mit.edu/discipline/history-theory-and-criticism" target="_blank">historian</a>, an <a class="link" href="https://www.architecture.yale.edu/" target="_blank">architect</a>, and an <a class="link" href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">engineer</a>. In 2017 I left academia after a postdoc, and today I bring my skills, experience, and interests together through data visualization. This site shows some of my personal work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have a <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/smtology" target="_blank">wide variety of interests</a>, and really, really love learning new things, through both reading/other media and direct engagement with the world.</p><p></p>

<p>Currently I'm thinking a lot about uncertainty, from technical/mathematical, social, and visualization  perspectives. Ian Hacking's <a class="link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/the-emergence-of-probability/9852017A380C63DA30886D25B80336A7" target="_blank"><em>The Emergence of Probability</em></a> and <a class="link" href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/history-ideas-and-intellectual-history/taming-chance#tPplFiHcMSxB7pqA.97" target="_blank"><em>The Taming of Chance</em></a>, and Ted Porter's <a class="link" href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/5653.html" target="_blank"><em>Trust in Numbers</em></a> were formative texts for me in this domain. For visualizations, I love working with the <a class="link" href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">d3 library</a>, and I think it is criminal how little attention is paid to Jacques Bertin's 1967 <a class="link" href="https://visionscarto.net/la-semiologie-graphique-a-50-ans" target="_blank"><em>Sémiologie graphique</em></a>. I believe that interactive visualizations are an amazing tool for allowing people to understand the world.</p><p></p>

<p>Je parle français und auch deutsch and I have a soft spot for all things Singapore, having taught at <a class="link" href="https://sutd.edu.sg/" v>Singapore University of Technology and Design</a> for three semesters. </p><p></p>

<p>I currently live in Cambridge/Somerville, MA.</p>
